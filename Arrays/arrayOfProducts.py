# Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns an array of the same length, where each element in the output array is equal 
# to the product of every other number in the input array.
# In other words, the value at output[i] is equal to the product of every number in the input array other than input[i].

# Sample input -> array = [5, 1, 4, 2] , Output -> [8, 40, 10, 20]

# Solution
