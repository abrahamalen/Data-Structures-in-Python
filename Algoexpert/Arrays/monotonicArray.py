"""
Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic.
An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.
Non-increasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively increasing; they simply don't decrease.
Not that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.

Sample Input: array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]
Sample Output: true
